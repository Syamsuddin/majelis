## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Types of Contributions
We welcome the following types of contributions:
- Bug fixes
- Feature enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements
- UI/UX enhancements

### Before You Start
1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/originalowner/emajelis/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/originalowner/emajelis/pulls)
2. Create an issue to discuss major changes before implementing
3. Ensure your idea aligns with the project's goals

### Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Commit your changes with clear messages
5. Push your branch to your fork
6. Create a pull request

## üéØ Coding Standards

### PHP Standards
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docblock comments for functions and classes
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### Frontend Standards
- Use Bootstrap classes consistently
- Follow existing CSS naming conventions
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Optimize for performance
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

### File Organization
- Place new PHP files in appropriate directories
- Use consistent file naming (lowercase with underscores)
- Keep files focused and modular
- Separate concerns appropriately

### Code Examples

#### PHP Function Documentation
```php
/**
 * Get user by ID with optional jemaah data
 * 
 * @param mysqli $koneksi Database connection
 * @param int $user_id User ID to retrieve
 * @param bool $include_jemaah Include jemaah data if available
 * @return array|null User data or null if not found
 */
function getUserById($koneksi, $user_id, $include_jemaah = false) {
    // Implementation here
}
```

#### Database Query Standards
```php
// Good - Using prepared statements
$stmt = $koneksi->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ? AND status = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("is", $user_id, $status);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();

// Bad - Direct string concatenation
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $user_id;
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
- Test all modified functionality
- Check different user roles (admin, operator, jemaah)
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test form validations and error handling
- Ensure data integrity

### Test Cases to Cover
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Form submissions and validations
- Filter and search functionality
- Pagination and data display

### Browser Testing
Test on the following browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
